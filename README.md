This  is a platform to store and manage saved urls in different categories. Tags can also be attached to the saved urls, so as to provide better searching. You can find the application at [links Organizer](https://links-organizer-react.pages.dev/)

Some features of this app:

- save URL's in different categories
- attach tags to the saved Urls
- attach background to the categories

### Comparison with Bookmark Feature of Browser

If you think, you may find this platform's working to be very similar to that of Bookmarking Feature of the browser, but Links Organizer certainly has some better features, as bookmarking has :

- no option for creating categories.
- has no option to attach tags to saved URL's.
- no searching functionality.
- no filters to easily find the saved Url.

## Built With

Links Organizer is highly secure and easy to use, and provides a lot of benefits, this is achieved using :
